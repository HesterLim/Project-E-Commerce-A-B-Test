# Project-E-Commerce-A-B-Test

## Outline ## 
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Understand the Dataset ##
This project contains two datasets which are ab_data.csv and countries.csv.

### ab_data.csv
1. There are five columns namely user_id , timestamp , group, landing_page and converted.
2. For the group column, there are only treatment group and control group 
3. For the landing_page column, there are old_page and new_page.
4. For the converted column, there are only 0 which means not converted and 1 which means converted.

### countries.csv
1. It contains the relevant information regarding the countries the user lives in.

## Installation

1. pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. csv

_I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) , which comes with all the necessary packages , as well as IPython notebook_
